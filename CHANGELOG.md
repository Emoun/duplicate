# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.6] - 2020-07-13

### Added

- New feature named `pretty_errors` (enabled by default). When enabled, errors are more detailed and helpful.
- New feature named `module_disambiguation` (enabled by default). When enabled, automatically uses a suitable substitution identifier to disambiguate the name of a module being duplicated. See the documentation for more details. See also [#7](https://github.com/Emoun/duplicate/issues/7).

### Changed

- Errors are now less detailed and helpful unless the `pretty_errors` feature is enabled.
- The dependence on the `proc_macro_error` crate is now optional and used by the `pretty_errors` feature.

## [0.2.5] - 2020-06-29

### Fixed

- Fixed a build issue when using version 1.0.3 of `proc_macro_error`. See [#11](https://github.com/Emoun/duplicate/issues/11).

### Changed

- The `proc_macro_error` dependency is fixed to version 1.0.3 to avoid potential breaking changes with future updates to that crate. 

## [0.2.4] - 2020-06-23

### Fixed

- Fixed issue with the short syntax where substitutions that included any bracket type would be expanded wrong. See [#9](https://github.com/Emoun/duplicate/issues/9).

## [0.2.3] - 2020-06-21 [YANKED]

### Added

- Short syntax now supports parameterized substitution. 
This allows identifiers to take arguments that can be used to customize the substitution for each use.
See [#5](https://github.com/Emoun/duplicate/issues/5).

## [0.2.2] - 2020-05-17

### Added

- Short syntax now supports nested macro invocations. Can only be used after the initial list of substitution identifiers. See [#2](https://github.com/Emoun/duplicate/issues/2).

### Changed

- Updated documentation. The short syntax is now used for the primary examples.
- Crate readme license section no longer includes paragraph on the licensing of contibutions.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where `#[duplicate(..)]`  would throw an error if it was generated by a macro expansion. 
It would fail if a substitution identifier originated from a macro variable.
This is caused by the variable's expansion sometimes being wrapped in a 
[group](https://doc.rust-lang.org/proc_macro/struct.Group.html) with 
[no delimiters](https://doc.rust-lang.org/proc_macro/enum.Delimiter.html#variant.None), 
which `duplicate` couldn't handle.

## [0.2.1] - 2020-04-26

### Changed

- Updated crate readme to new short syntax.

## [0.2.0] - 2020-04-26

### Added

- Crate readme changelog section now asserts the use of [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) and [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

### Changed

- New short syntax with row-based substitution groups instead of the old column-based syntax.
See [github issue](https://github.com/Emoun/duplicate/issues/1).

## [0.1.5] - 2020-04-12

### Changed

- Crate readme format titles are now bigger than changelog entries.

## [0.1.4] - 2020-04-12

## [0.1.2] - 2020-04-9

### Added
