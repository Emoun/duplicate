## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Short syntax now supports nested macro invocations. Can only be used after the initial list of substitution identifiers. See [#2](https://github.com/Emoun/duplicate/issues/2).

### Changed

- Crate readme license section no longer includes paragraph on the licensing of contibutions.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where `#[duplicate(..)]`  would throw an error if it was generated by a macro expansion. 
It would fail if a substitution identifier originated from a macro variable.
This is caused by the variable's expansion sometimes being wrapped in a 
[group](https://doc.rust-lang.org/proc_macro/struct.Group.html) with 
[no delimiters](https://doc.rust-lang.org/proc_macro/enum.Delimiter.html#variant.None), 
which `duplicate` couldn't handle.
