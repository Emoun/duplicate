## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.4] - 2020-06-23

### Fixed

- Fixed issue with the short syntax where substitutions that included any bracket type would be expanded wrong. See [#9](https://github.com/Emoun/duplicate/issues/9).

## [0.2.3] - 2020-06-21 [YANKED]

### Added

- Short syntax now supports parameterized substitution. 
This allows identifiers to take arguments that can be used to customize the substitution for each use.
See [#5](https://github.com/Emoun/duplicate/issues/5).

## [0.2.2] - 2020-05-17

### Added

- Short syntax now supports nested macro invocations. Can only be used after the initial list of substitution identifiers. See [#2](https://github.com/Emoun/duplicate/issues/2).

### Changed

- Updated documentation. The short syntax is now used for the primary examples.
- Crate readme license section no longer includes paragraph on the licensing of contibutions.

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where `#[duplicate(..)]`  would throw an error if it was generated by a macro expansion. 
It would fail if a substitution identifier originated from a macro variable.
This is caused by the variable's expansion sometimes being wrapped in a 
[group](https://doc.rust-lang.org/proc_macro/struct.Group.html) with 
[no delimiters](https://doc.rust-lang.org/proc_macro/enum.Delimiter.html#variant.None), 
which `duplicate` couldn't handle.

## [0.2.1] - 2020-04-26

### Changed

## [0.2.0] - 2020-04-26

### Changed

- New short syntax with row-based substitution groups instead of the old column-based syntax.
See [github issue](https://github.com/Emoun/duplicate/issues/1).
